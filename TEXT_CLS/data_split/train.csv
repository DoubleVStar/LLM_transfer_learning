"While other antioxidants, such as tocopherols,66 have the potential to exert similar effects, bilirubin is unique in its ability to readily diffuse into cells67 and to be continuously regenerated by intracellular redox cycling through the action of the ubiquitous biliverdin reductase enzyme.18 It is notable that endothelial adhesion molecules have been implicated in the pathogenesis of a number of inflammatory disorders,10, 20, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72 and bilirubin has been shown to ameliorate animal models of VCAMâ?â?and ICAMâ?âmediated inflammation, including colitis,20 allergic pneumonitis,19 and encephalomyelitis.73 Given that the inducible isoform of HOâ?, which catalyzes the rateâlimiting step in bilirubin synthesis, appears to play a key role in attenuating inflammation,74 we speculate that HOâ?âgenerated bilirubin may serve a fundamental physiological function with regard to regulation of inflammatory responses.","Animal research, In vivo studies"

"SCFAs can also promote a regulatory immune response by stimulating the differentiation and suppressive capacity of Foxp3+Tregs in the intestine, which may modulate the development of obesity by decreasing the chronic low-grade inflammation characteristic of this condition.3 The increased stool SCFA levels in helminth-infected mice probably results from changes to microbiota structures that favor SCFA-producing bacterial communities, which may improve the metabolic profile in mice.41 However, it may be also possible that the increased stool SCFA levels result from reduced absorption of SCFAs in the gut, contributing to reduced weight gain and fat deposition in infected mice, which is consistent with the notion that excessive SCFAs produced by gut microbiota may also represent an additional energy source, causing an imbalance in energy regulation that contributes to obesity.42 Our analysis showed that helminth-infected mice and the recipients of helminth-infected donors displayed increased expression of GPR41, GPR43, and GPR109a in the liver and colon compared with the corresponding control animals.","Animal research, In vivo studies"
