Thus, its modulation is a promising strategy to restore gut microbiota and improve intestinal health in the obese. This paper examines the role of probiotics, antimicrobials, and diet in modulating gut microbiota and improving intestinal health. Accordingly, obesity was induced in C57BL/6J mice, after which they were redistributed and fed with an obesogenic diet (intervention A) or standard AIN-93 diet (intervention B). Concomitantly, all the groups underwent a treatment phase with Lactobacillus gasseri LG-G12, ceftriaxone, or ceftriaxone followed by L. gasseri LG-G12. At the end of the experimental period, the following analysis was conducted: metataxonomic analysis, functional profiling of gut microbiota, intestinal permeability, and caecal concentration of short-chain fatty acids. High-fat diet impaired bacterial diversity/richness, which was counteracted in association with L. gasseri LG-G12 and the AIN-93 diet. Additionally, SCFA-producing bacteria were negatively correlated with high intestinal permeability parameters, which was further confirmed via functional profile prediction of the gut microbiota. A novel perspective on anti-obesity probiotics is presented by these findings based on the improvement of intestinal health irrespective of undergoing antimicrobial therapy or not.",

As previously described [39,40], the use of antibiotics can harm the intestinal epithelium, as well as favor the growth of specific microbial taxa.

Regarding the phylum Spirochaetes, although its identification in fecal samples has not been associated with obesity, Jabbar et al. [44] reported the association between Brachyspira and irritable bowel syndrome. Our results indicate a limited impact of the LG-G12 in controlling the two aforementioned taxa.

Interestingly, following LG-G12 administration, the F/B ratio decreased in the cefriatoxane + LG-G12 A group (G5).

The enrichment of the genera Bifidobacterium is in agreement with the literature, where an inverse relationship was shown between this genus and obesity. Bifidobacteria deconjugate bile acids, decreasing fat absorption [47]. The higher abundance of Oscillospira in the gut of lean subjects has been addressed in several studies and is positively associated with lower body mass index (BMI) in both children and adults [48]. It is also well reported that a high-fat diet can significantly reduce the intestinal abundance of Allobaculum, a relevant SCFA-producing bacteria, which may display an anti-obesogenic role by reducing intestinal inflammation and improving insulin resistance [49,50,51]. The increase in the relative abundance of the genera Jeotgalicoccus and Sporosarcina, although less described in the literature, are associated with beneficial outcomes in animal models fed high-fat diets [52,53]. To the best of our knowledge, there is no available information regarding the role of Yaniella, a high salt-tolerant microorganism, in healthy or obese subjects. Overall, our results show that low-calorie diets are beneficial to the maintenance of taxa that are negatively associated with obesity.",

Interestingly, Akkermansia, which is a Gram-negative, obligate anaerobe, non-motile, non-spore-forming bacterium, seems to be resilient to the adverse effects of the antimicrobial ceftriaxone. This genus has attracted great interest due to its capability to enhance mucus formation, activate the innate immune system, and promote intestinal homeostasis [61]. As reported by Vesić & Kristich [62], the genus Enterococcus is intrinsically resistant to cephalosporins, antibiotics that act on cell wall biosynthesis, which may explain its identification as a biomarker of this group. Additionally, Mishra & Ghosh [63] reports that the E. faecalis AG5 strain mitigates HFD-induced obesity through several mechanisms such as activation of adipocyte apoptosis and the improvement of glucose, insulin, and leptin sensitivity.",

In addition, we focused on identifying metabolic pathways related to SCFA production that can directly impact intestinal health. Taking into account the comparison between groups G7 and G3, 58 functional pathways differed significantly between the groups (Table S1), and the great majority (approximately 69.0%) were enriched in group G7. Regarding the MetaCyc pathways associated with SCFA production, six metabolic pathways were identified (Figure 5), and four of them were present in group G7 (Bifidobacterium shunt, heterolactic fermentation, hexitol fermentation to lactate, formate, ethanol, and acetate). The enrichment of Bifidobacterium shunt, which is a classic pathway of carbohydrate metabolisms such as fructose and glucose, can generate compounds serving as an energy source for intestinal epithelial cells [68,75], which explains the greater intestinal integrity noticed in this group. Only the acetyl-Coa fermentation to butanoate II and L-lysine fermentation to acetate and butanoate pathways were enriched in the G3 group.",

The enrichment of the super pathway of D-glucarate and D-galactarate degradation in group G5 also demonstrates the use of alternative carbon sources for growth. The use of dicarboxylic acid sugars as growth substrate occurs in many different bacteria but is especially found in Gram-negative bacteria such as members of the Enterobacteriaceae, Moraxellaceae, and Pseudomonadaceae families [76]. Metabolic pathways, Bifidobacterium shunt, and heterolactic fermentation, associated with SCFA production were enriched only in group G9 (Figure S5). Similarly, in the G9 group, we also observed the enrichment of the Bifidobacterium shunt and heterolactic fermentation pathways, both associated with carbohydrate metabolism [77], which evidence an important role of low-calorie diets in the enrichment of these functions. Interestingly, the super pathway of D-glucarate and D-galactarate degradation and the pathway of purine nucleotide degradation II (aerobic) were enriched in the G5 group. This indicates that this group of microbes is using alternative carbon sources.",

The main metabolic pathways enriched in the G4 group were associated with menaquinol biosynthesis and de novo nucleotide biosynthesis. The enrichment of menaquinol biosynthesis might be related to the energy processes of bacteria since menaquinones are relevant growth factors for gut microbiota [78,79] Traditionally, the gut microbiota is an important source of purines, which are used in different functions related to the intestinal barrier and innate immunity, being necessary for intestinal protection and health [80]. Since dysbiosis was observed in group G4, it is believed that the enrichment of nucleotide biosynthesis pathways confirms an expansion of specific microbial taxa in this group.",

Also, the genera that presented a negative correlation with a high L/M ratio were similar to those that had a positive correlation with total SCFA production. This trend was further confirmed by metagenomic predictions of the gut microbiota.
